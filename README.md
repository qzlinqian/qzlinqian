#### About me
I am currently a PhD student in Mechenical Engineering at MIT. I graduated from Tsinghua University with a Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science in 2020.

I'm now working on automatic ultrasound in Device Realization Lab at MIT.

#### Sparetime
- I started a [podcast](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hXuqh_BiHiQFRw3lxtN1pw) in WeChat with some friends to share some (Chinese) literature works, hoping to refresh and strengthen our minds. You are also welcomed to reach me about this if interested.
- I also have a [personal blog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WTs27amc-N4gmgxsZ2bCaw) (in Chinese 饮石泉兮荫松柏) on WeChat, where I share some of my literature creation.
- Welcome to my personal website, which also hosts my two current hobbies, [cooking (浮蜜轩)](http://www.qianl.in/2022/06/02/fumixuan/) and [hanfu (倚风堂)](http://www.qianl.in/2022/06/02/yifengtang/).
