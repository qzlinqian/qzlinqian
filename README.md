I am currently a master student in Mechenical Engineering at MIT. I graduated from Tsinghua University with a Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science in 2020.

It seems the pandemic also keeps me away from coding, and all my websites stopped updating. I'm now working in Device Realization Lab at MIT and starting some ultrasound medical device and imaging work.

Fun fact: I started a podcast in WeChat with some friends to share some (Chinese) literature works, hoping to refresh and strengthen our minds. You are also welcomed to reach me about this if interested.

Good luck to myself and to you guys.
